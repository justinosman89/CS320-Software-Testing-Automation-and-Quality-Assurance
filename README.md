Ensuring Code Functionality and Security

To ensure the functionality and security of all the code in ContactService, I used a careful unit testing approach when developing the mobile application. My testing strategy covered a range of scenarios, including positive, negative, and edge cases, specifically made for the features of ContactService. The tests were made to align with the given software requirements, making sure that each element of the code met the designated specifications. I felt that by systematically validating functionality and correctness, I guaranteed a more secure and reliable application.

Interpreting User Needs and Incorporating Them

Interpreting user needs should always be a main focus when developming any application. In the code for the mobile app I aligned the testing process and functionalities with exact software requirements, this verified that the program met the specific needs of the end-users. An example of this is the tests for ContactService that were designed to validate the uniqueness and length constraints of essential contact information, which was what the user wanted. With this approach I tried to eliminate confusion, and make the application more intuitive and tailored to the client's needs.

Approach to Designing Software

The approach I used when designing software, like ContactService, involved using a systematic and objective testing strategy. By making sure I tested everything thoroughly and fully understood how the code work, my design created a reliable and strong system. In my Project Two Summary Report I tried to show a disciplined mindset in code writing, adherence to coding standards, and efficient implementation. My approach, seen in the methods and tests for ContactService, not only confirms functionality but also ensures overall performance.
